In each room we will have a GPS module from which we can get the cordinates of the room and data of the coordinates will 
store in the cloud.
now when use clicks or ask for perticular room then from cloud data we will highlight loction of that room on the MAP.
And we are still thinking how to provide the shortest way.

Now if some group is arrived and that group member want to know where is my group partner then in starting we will make group in 
our application which share's common key between group memebers.
so using google map API those who has same key they can see each other on that map.
